## What are Design Patterns?
ADesign is crucial everywhere whether it's in art, architecture, engineering, science, and even cooking. In software engineering, design patterns are ways for us to find a solution to a problem and design it in our code in the most efficient way possible. Design patterns require not just logic but creativity as well and it takes many years of practice to be good at it. In fact, many experienced engineers gave their input on how to make great design patterns, and their methods are used by many engineers today.   
## Examples of Design Patterns
I've always found this cyber news interesting and it made me want to pursue cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is one of the most in-demand jobs in software engineering. It is an important job that will always be exciting. Things are continuously changing and the battlefield is continuously evolving so there will always be a new challenges. It is also an important job and when used correctly you can be an important member in protecting people from those who wish to harm others.

## The best Design Patterns
In the future, I hope to get into this field but I also want to prepare for it. I am currently in Grey Hats and I want to gain skills that I can use to fight against hackers and create secure software so that it is safe. There are still many things I need to learn so I hope to get an entry-level job that is beginner friendly then I can work my way up to develop software. I am not sure what company I would like to join but this is definitely the sector I would like to be in.
