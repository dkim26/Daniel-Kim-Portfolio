## *My perspective of Java script so far*

I am new to Javascript I am used to using C and C++. Javascript is a lot easier to use compared to C and C++ because it's not strictly typed. It is easier to declare variables and use functions compared to C and C++. It is still very similar to these languages since programming generally follows the same rules and syntax. However, it is different and I am still learning and getting used to the language. There were many libraries that I used in C and C++, and anytime I wanted to use their function I would have to include their library in my code. So far in Javascript, a lot of functions don't require a library. Also, from what I noticed so far I also don't need to set up my code, for example, in C I would need to include the stdio.h library and the main function. In Javascript, I could start coding right away.

## Is it good though?

Javascript so far is really easy and fun to use compared to my previous programming languages. It is so much easier to get started with and start coding in and you don have to worry about naming variables all the time. Though I do find it weird how there are so many options in javascript such as using var, let, and const when declaring variables. In fact, I wonder why we learn to assign variables with var when let is much better to use. I also thought it was weird how when using a comparison operator we use === instead of == when we want to compare two values. There are many new rules to learn and I think it's fun to learn them because it is like learning to program again and it seems to be the modern way of programming. After using Javascript a bit C and C++ seem like outdated programming languages.

## Is Javascript a great langauge when under pressure?

Athletic software engineering or WODs(Word of the Day) is new to me and after practicing for a bit I really like using javascript. Compared to C and C++ it saves a lot of time since there is less code to write and less calling from libraries and functions. So far I was surprised by how fast I can code and compile something and for some reason, I make fewer errors when programming in Javascript. I feel like there is some magic when compiling javascript code. I feel like freecodecamp did a good job teaching me the concepts of javascript and WODs so far hasn’t been too bad. However, I do want to learn more and practice more with WOD’s and javascript to improve my software engineering skills.

## My future outlook on Javascript

I think I will use Javascript after finishing this class and it might be the main language that I use. There are many projects that can be done in javascript that could save time compared to using languages like C and C++. Also, we will have a lot of practice using many other frameworks that use Javascript so I am excited to build a project using this language.
