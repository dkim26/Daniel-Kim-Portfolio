## Learning a new IDE is like falling into a new world

<h2> It's also like moving into a new house </h2>
This week I was introduced to many new github commands and IntelliJ. Before taking this software engineering class I was used to VSCode. I thought VSCode was the best IDE to use but Intelliji is really good. At first it took alot of practice and getting used to but the UI and the framework is fairly simple to use that it didn't take too much time to get used to. I was originally worried and lost when I first started. It's like being thrown into the water and learning how to swim or moving into a new house and learning where each room is. Sure it's shocking at first but once I got used to it I learned to adapt and eventually learned to appreciate it.
## ESLint "The Spellchecker of coding"
ESLint was surprisingly good at finding mistakes or improving your code. It is basically the spellchecker of coding. There were many times where I wasn't really paying attention to my codebase and ESLint fixed the mistakes and errors for me. Not even VSCode was able to assist me this much. I do find the warning and check marks annoying and even unnecessary at times but I do think that it is important and I find it useful. After fixing all of my mistakes my codebase looks alot better.
## The Magic of Github
I was also shown a new and more efficient way of Github in my early programming class. I was taught how to use Github but we ran the git commands in the terminal. So git clone, git status, git add, git commit, and git push were all the commands we needed to use to clone and push our repo. The most annoying and irritating part of cloning into a terminal is that we have to login and insert our personal token. This takes too much time and is very tedious. I was taught a new way of cloning and pushing our changes and that is through Github Desktop. It is like magic and takes way less time. I was surprised that with the click of a few buttons I have already cloned and pushed my repo. This is definitely a useful skill that I will use throughout my future.
## So IntelliJ or VSCode?
After using Intellij for a week I definitely prefer using Intellij for Javascript or web design applications. However, I will probably still use VSCode for C/C++ and maybe Python if I ever get to learn it. I don't think I will be using VSCode for the time being just because I want to devote my time to Javascript and this class.
