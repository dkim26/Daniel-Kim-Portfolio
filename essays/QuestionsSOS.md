## *Yes there are dumb questions*


Many people have the misconception that there are no dumb questions. However, this is not the case and there are questions that you should not be asking. As software engineers it is important to communicate effectively and to do that we need to ask the right questions. It is important how we convey the question and if the question is a valid one. We should at least do a google search before posting a question because chances are someone asked the same exact question as you.
