## The Finale of my Journey in this Class

## What I learned
I learned a lot in ICS 314 and there were many topics that I was introduced to and had to learn quickly. This class was pretty challenging and fast-paced in the beginning. There were times when I would forget my assignment because there were so frequent. I started off this semester badly but eventually, once I got the hang of this class my grade just kept going up and up. Now that the semester is over looking back I am surprised by the amount of knowledge that I gained as a software engineer. There were many topics and tools that I can use in the future and it made me more confident.
