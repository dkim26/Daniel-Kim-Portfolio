<h2> SCADA  </h2>
The UH Manoa SCADA Lab aims to create a Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using a machine learning algorithm to classify network traffic as normal or abnormal, we use a Software-Defined Network (SDN) to create a custom IDS. Most of the work is done on Raspberry Pi’s. We learn and work with many things such as network ports, VLANS, and a windows active directory. Each member in the lab has their own role and mine was the Linux System Admin. However, we would collaborate and work together with other teams to get results.

<h2> CAPSTONE Project </h2>
This was the senior project that I started last semester, and it is ongoing as I am doing it this semester. As the Linux System Admin, it is my job to create and maintain the computers (mostly Raspberry Pi’s) in the lab. Raspberry Pi’s uses Linux Operating System (OS). Every software application installed on our Pi’s is approved or installed by me. It is also the Linux System Admin's job to constantly monitor these devices and track changes. It is the Linux Admin's job to multi-home the Pi's and set them up on their VLANs. VLANs are Virtual Local Area Networks which are subnets (Independent Broadcast Domains). In this lab, we have four VLANs. The first VLAN is the general VLAN which is where most of our Pi’s are connected, the second is the SDN controller, the third is the SEL[3] (Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories), and the fourth is the security VLAN.

<h2> The Big Mission going foward </h2>
This semester I hope to create an Active Directory-based single sign-on authentication scheme. Each user will have their own username and password. Currently, each Pi has a common username and password shared between all lab members. This is not safe. However, if a user has their own unique username and password they can just sign in to any Pi using their credentials thus improving accountability and authorization. We also plan on updating the DHCP, DNS, and time server for all existing Pi’s
